HiDALGO2,"Urban Air Project: evolution of air in urban areas considering pollution, wind, comfort and planning. The core is the Urban Air Flow (UAP.AF) computational model, based on two main  software: OpenFOAM and Fluid-Solver. For both solvers, modelling of more physical properties will be developed including thermal convection, solar heat radiation, transport and reaction between several species.",
